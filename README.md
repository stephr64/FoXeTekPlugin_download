This plugin is built for Laminar Research X-Plane 11/12 Flight Simulator for the Android app Airbus MCDU from FoXeTek. Please refer to the Google Play Store for more information, or on the foxetek.fr page (note: it's down today though, my provider screwed something... back soon).<br><br>
Note: this plugin is *not* intended to be used in standalone mode. The protocole, although not encripted, is not documented on purpose and is not supported. You are free to use the plugin as a playground, but again, you then implicitely accept not to request any support.<br><br>
